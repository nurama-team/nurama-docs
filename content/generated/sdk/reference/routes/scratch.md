## Interfaces

### CompleteUploadBody

#### Properties

| Property | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| <a id="parts"></a> `parts` | \{ `ETag`: `string`; `PartNumber`: `number`; \}[] |
| <a id="uploadid"></a> `uploadId` | `string` |

***

### CompleteUploadResponse

#### Properties

| Property | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| <a id="id"></a> `id` | `string` |
| <a id="url"></a> `url` | `string` \| `null` |

***

### PromoteBody

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="filename"></a> `fileName?` | `string` | Optional rename — lands on `Asset.name`. Defaults to a row-id-derived name. |

***

### PromoteResponse

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="alreadypromoted"></a> `alreadyPromoted` | `boolean` | `true` when the scratch row was already promoted on a prior call (e.g. the same revision was Attached-to-chat earlier and the chat-send pipeline ran the promote synchronously). The returned `asset` is the existing one. The FE should treat this as a no-op for "newly added" UX (toast copy, list-refresh side effects) while still surfacing the asset. |
| <a id="asset"></a> `asset` | `unknown` | - |

## Functions

### default()

```ts
function default(client): {
  completeUpload: Promise<CompleteUploadResponse>;
  promote: Promise<PromoteResponse>;
};
```

Scratch — platform-wide temporary object-storage with explicit lifecycle.

There is NO public surface for creating scratch rows or minting
upload URLs. Parent processes (e.g. AI Revision) initiate the
multipart upload server-side and return the
`{ scratchId, uploadId, key, urls[] }` bundle in their own response
payload. The FE uploads each part directly against its signed URL
(same pattern as asset uploads), then calls `completeUpload` here to
finalise.

`completeUpload` mirrors `nuramaClient.asset.completeUpload`:
the body is the same `{ uploadId, parts }` shape, the server runs the
S3-compatible `CompleteMultipartUploadCommand`, and (for scratch
specifically) HEADs the resulting object, increments workspace
storage usage, and writes the audit row.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `client` | [`default`](../NuramaClient.md#default) |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `completeUpload()` | (`scratchId`, `data`) => `Promise`\<[`CompleteUploadResponse`](#completeuploadresponse)\> | Finish a multipart upload for a scratch row. Same `{ uploadId, parts }` body the asset complete-upload route accepts. Server runs `CompleteMultipartUploadCommand` against the media bucket, HEADs the object for size, increments workspace storage usage, writes the audit row, and flips status pendingUpload → active. Creator-only. |
| `promote()` | (`scratchId`, `data?`) => `Promise`\<[`PromoteResponse`](#promoteresponse)\> | Promote a scratch row to a real Asset. Creator-only — only the user who created the scratch row can call this. Destination is derived server-side from the row itself: - row has `projectId` → asset created in that project - row has only workspace → asset created at the workspace No body fields for destination on purpose: the FE doesn't get to claim a scratch belongs to a different workspace / project. The only optional input is `fileName` to override the asset's user-facing name. |
